        <div class="blue"><p>The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans. The word comes from the Latin natura meaning "birth". Nature includes many things like weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies. Scientists study the way the parts of nature work. Things that have been made by people are said to be man-made or called artifacts.
             There are natural sciences that study different parts of nature, for example the science of ecology is about plants and animals as a whole, while biology studies every type of living thing.
             From one point of view, humans are a prime example of nature, and are the most widely studied natural inhabitants of the planet earth. Humans interact with each other in their natural environment on a day-to-day basis. Every part of nature – everything from the air outside to the dirt on the ground – is interdependent. Medicine studies humans in health and sickness.
             From another point of view, humans and nature can be said to be in conflict. People always use natural
             resources. They cut down trees, mine ores, grow crops and manufacture things from natural material. Fires,
              cars, and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places. People who like to leave nature unharmed and
               those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do. In the modern world, 
            with many more people and many big cities, these problems are becoming more serious.Nature, in the broadest sense, means the physical world as a whole. This is the meaning that physics, the study of nature (etymologically), takes.
             A useful definition of natural is"Happening or operating in accordance with the ordinary course of nature". Oxford
             Shorter English Dictionary says the word in this 
            sense is first found in 1477.</p></div>

        <p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in 
            flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers produce gametophytes, which
             in flowering plants consist of a few haploid cells that produce gametes. The "male" gametophyte,
              which produces non-motile sperm, is enclosed within pollen grains; the "female" gametophyte is 
              contained within the ovule. When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma,
               this is called pollination. Some flowers may self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from 
               the same flower or a different flower of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to prevent 
               self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one 
               flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species.
 Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so
  that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant
   to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.[1] Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization
    (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop.
  Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen between 
  different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, including brightly 
  colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food source for pollinators.
  [2] In this way, many flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators to be mutually dependent on services they
   provide to one another—in the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of food.
   [3] After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.
 Flowers have long been appreciated by humans for their beauty and pleasant scents, and also hold cultural significance as religious, ritual, or symbolic objects, or sources of medicine and food.</p>
